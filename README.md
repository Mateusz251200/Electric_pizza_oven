**Design and software for a homemade electric pizza oven with PID temperature control.**

*Disclaimer:*
This is a personal hobby project. While the main goal is to design and build my own electric pizza oven, it also serves as a learning challenge â€” especially in the areas of control systems, STM32-based software development, and the design of electrical and mechanical hardware.
