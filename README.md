# Electric pizza oven project

**Design and software for a homemade electric pizza oven with PID temperature control.**

**Status:** Early work in progress

*Disclaimer:* This is a personal project. While the main goal is to build something functional, it's also part of my learning process, so some solutions may not be optimal.

## Planned features

- Temperature rage: up to 500°C
- PID temperature control, possibly with some kind of auto tuning
- Independent top and bottom heating elements, each with its temperature sensor
- Various heating modes
  - single temperature setpoint with heaters coupled together (single control loop)
  - single temperature setpoint with total power divided between heaters according to a set ratio (single control loop)
  - top and bottom temperatures controlled independently (two control loops)
  - manual control (open loop)
- User interface including an LCD (HD44780) with an interactive menu
- Overheating protection
- USB connection for diagnostic data
- System based on an STM32 MCU (specific model not yet selected; the NUCLEO-F303RE is used for prototyping)

## Progress list

- 🔄 Control panel
  - ✅🔧 HD44780 LCD driver (I2C+DMA)
  - 🔄 Interactive menu
- ⏳ Temperature measurement circuit
- ⏳ PID controller
- ⏳ Heating modes
- ⏳ Heating elements and solid state relays
- ⏳ Cooling fan for the electronics compartment

Legend: ✅ — works; 🔧 — needs improvement; 🔄 — in progress; ⏳ — not yet started

*Note:* The software is developed using STM32CubeMX, CMake, and VS Code with the STM32Cube extension.
